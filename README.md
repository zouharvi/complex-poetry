# Genre Complexity

Code for experiments in [Poetry, Songs, Literature, Legalese and Translationese: Automated Sentence Complexity Perspective](https://vilda.net/papers/automated_sentence_complexity_perspective.pdf).

Abstract:

> Although non-trivial to measure, natural texts come in varying complexities.
> As a result, multiple domains and genres can be compared based on their complexities.
> In this study, focused on measuring sentence complexity, I use automated methods of complexity estimation to compare poetry, natural prose, literary prose and machine and human translation.
> The conclusion is that old poetry and old literature is more complex than their modern counterparts, as measured by language model complexity, Flesch Reading Ease and syntactic depth.
> Furthermore, we observe that machine translations are faithful to human references in terms of sentence complexity, which is a positive result for the translation industry.
> Most importantly, this paper discusses the reason for different complexities across varying text domains, which is framed as ``form (complexity) follows function and aesthetics with least effort.''
